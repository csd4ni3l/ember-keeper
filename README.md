Ember Keeper is a platformer 2D game where you have to escape the outside temperatures, while collecting firewood to keep yourself warm while being out in the open.

The game is locked at 60 FPS since every interaction depends on that and i am lazy to introduce delta time.
The game can be speedrunned and there is an option for hitboxes as well.
